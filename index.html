  	  <h1>Hello there!</h1>
  	  <p>
  	    What is this all about? Hm... It's a work-in-progress website where I try my hand 
  	    at web design because it's a really fun hobby (so far)! I want to make easy to navigate 
  	    pages that I can experiment code on. In time I hope some of the pages will double up as 
  	    a compliment to my CV, showcasing work I've done and perhaps even some of my personality.
  	    <br></br> 
  	    In particular, my master's project I wrote at University College London as part of 
  	    my Mathematics MSci degree can be found on the 'MATHS' page. The study is specialised 
  	    in fluid mechanics and seeks ways of modelling 'what happens when a dam breaks?'. The question
  	    is a standard undergraduate problem if the floor is assumed smooth. But for a realistic model, friction
  	    must be considered - consequently, alternative methods need to be adopted to find elegant 
  	    solutions to the equations governing the fluid flow. If you're keen on learning more (or just seeing
  	    some seriously asthetically pleasing graphs), grab a cup of tea and head over to the page now... 
  	    <br></br>
  	    Otherwise, there's plenty to have a browse through. Some pages will be more developed than 
  	    others. As I said, it's a work-in-progress.
