      <h1>Snap snap</h1>
      <p>It was a Sunday evening in London, gloomy, close, and stale. 
Maddening church bells of all degrees of dissonance, sharp and 
flat, cracked and clear, fast and slow, made the brick-and-mortar 
echoes hideous. Melancholy streets, in a penitential garb of soot, 
steeped the souls of the people who were condemned to look at them 
out of windows, in dire despondency. In every thoroughfare, up 
almost every alley, and down almost every turning, some doleful 
bell was throbbing, jerking, tolling, as if the Plague were in the 
city and the dead-carts were going round. Everything was bolted 
and barred that could by possibility furnish relief to an 
overworked people. No pictures, no unfamiliar animals, no rare 
plants or flowers, no natural or artificial wonders of the ancient 
world--all TABOO with that enlightened strictness, that the ugly 
South Sea gods in the British Museum might have supposed themselves 
at home again. Nothing to see but streets, streets, streets. 
Nothing to breathe but streets, streets, streets.</p>
