      <h1>All good things...</h1>
      <p class=blog>
        I've not written on here for several months, next to nobody reads it and I really have better things to be getting on with, but the World Wide Web simply will not be complete without the final chapter of this blog. So let's get on with it.<br><br><br>
        Ok, my last post was written way back I don't know when - but I mentioned hoping to 'break the 15 mile barrier soon' so it must have been a while ago. Long story short, I gradually inched up the weekend long run every other week, eventually reached 19 miles a month before the marathon and then stopped. I was foolish. My longest runs were a 19 miler, an 18 miler, a couple of 16-17 milers and many half marathon-15 milers. This, it turns out, is pretty perfect training for a half marathon and I nailed the hilly Winchester half two weeks before Budapest, running 1hr35.<br><br><br>
        Perhaps this was a blessing and a curse - in theory, if you're fully trained for a marathon and you can run a 1hr35 half, you should get around a full marathon comfortably under 3 hours 30. This was an appealing target not just because it's a fairly respectable time but also because the maths is so nice. By some luck 210 divides perfectly by 42 to give 5 - 42 being roughly the distance of a marathon in kilometres. Since each kilometre on the course is marked (yes, Budapest is European and boringly metric) that meant pacing myself for a 3 and a half hour marathon would be a doddle. Pass each kilometre mark every five minutes. Easy arithmetic.<br><br><br>
        Turns out on the day I ran the first 10 kilometres in 47 minutes and felt great. My legs fresh, my breathing steady and my blue UCL cap (to stop sweat going in my eyes) dry. Figuring I was 3 minutes ahead of the 5-min/km schedule I eased up and hit the preplanned pace from then on. This meant I made it through the half marathon point in 1 hour 42 - still 3 minutes ahead of the 3 and a half hour marathon. My cap had now turned entirely to a darker shade of blue, except the very tip of the front that was instead soaking up the sun to save my eyes from squinting. The next 15 minutes running on the Buda edge of the Danube towards the sun drifted away quickly and took me roughly to the 15 mile point where things became sticky. I've hit walls in training and passed it off as not being my day. I've never hit a wall on a long run before though - I guess I ran them all slowly enough that I didn't reach the point of entire exhaustion. This was different. This was 15 miles in. This was THE wall. This wasn't training and I really didn't want to stop. Every second seamed to have a different shape and character. Every step took intense concentration like I was a baby learning to walk. It's strange how quickly my legs turned against me and my mind fed them the negative encouragement to rebel further. In terms of how it felt physically, it was like running into the sea from the shore. Running along sand feels light and easy, then you hit the water and the resistance cripples your stride. Eventually you're waist deep and you can hardly run at all. Yet I was on a tarmac road on a dry and still day. The only resistance to my motion was my brain telling me the body has had enough, that my legs were heavy as lead and the surrounding muscles were useless in comparison to their weight. However, the clever (and simultaneously stupid) thing about humans is that we can override ourselves with sheer stubbornness. I'd read about the wall and understood that if I got through it I'd still have more to give - it's like evolutions equivalent of a red light on the fuel gauge.<br><br><br>
        So I pushed on, and on, for what felt like twice as long as it was. Each second still shifting personality and shape and form and each step still soaking up all my attention and will power. Sure enough, persistence paid and the wall subsided and was put behind me. It was still like running through water but the pain and the mental aspect had subsided as if we'd played a game of chicken and I'd won. The next four kilometres were hard graft but controlled and I watched the 28km sign drift over me as I ran under it with a grin because I knew I was two thirds of the way to the finish line. All I had to do was half of what I'd already done and I was a marathoner. Five minutes later, another kilometre later, at the 29km mark I slowed to a walk at the water station to grab a cup of something blue (PowerAde I think). It was fatal. The relief in my legs when I stopped running was mind-blowing. It took me by surprise - my body was so accustomed to the dull repetitive ache that I didn't feel it until I stopped running and it was no longer there. I was still 3 minutes ahead of pace so decided I'd take a couple of minutes to enjoy the bliss and fully refuel on the various tablets, drinks and foods on offer. When I started running again nothing felt right. The first few steps were as if someone were hammering nails into my buttocks. It was ridiculous pain and luckily was literally only for a few steps. After that I was back running with my normal stride but with abnormal difficulty and fatigue. I gritted my teeth, the same as at the wall. I started counting upwards from one in my head to distract myself. I reminded myself of Emil Zatopek's amazing Olympic marathon. I tried everything I could to will myself on. I was forced to a walk. In denial of the difficulty I fleshed out another 3 kilometres running as fast as I could. Admittedly, that was not that fast by this point. This took me to 20 miles (32km) where my parents were positioned to spectate. During those last 3km I already determined that would be my finish line. I called it a day having run roughly 20 miles in somewhere around 2 hours 40 minutes.<br><br><br>
        I started my Budapest experiment to see if I could RUN a marathon with 7 months training. I nearly made it! I slacked in the last couple of months and didn't put in the long runs. Lots of people have asked why I didn't walk or jog/walk the last section of the race. All I can really say is that you find yourself in a funny mindset after running for nearly three hours. Also I don't want to be a marathoner unless I truly am. Walking doesn't count.<br><br><br>
        It's naive to say I could have made it to the finish line had I ran slower. All day after the race I kicked myself convinced I would have. It's taken me a few more days to understand that even if that was true, it isn't the way I do things. I'd have been equally disappointed if I collected my finishers medal having not felt I'd deserved it. I don't feel like I entirely failed because I set out on a plan and bravely stuck with it refusing to drop the pace until I really had no choice. A kind of successful failure. In an odd way I have an admiration for my own stupid stubbornness; the achievements I'm proudest of owe themselves to that side of me.<br><br><br>
        For now, I'm resting until I can do normal daily things without wincing. I'm pretty much there (3 days after the marathon) and think I'll be back to usual tomorrow. Then I suspect I'll go on a gentle run and see how it goes. When I left the course in Budapest and laid on my back on the concrete to stretch my legs, I believed I'd never want to run again. In the hotel bed that night plans were already being hatched for attempt number two. After all of this I still love running - more than ever, actually.
